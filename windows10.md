# Windows 10

This guide was written on Windows 10 and it obviously assumes that you have already installed git for windows and have the git bash terminal ready.

Basically follow this guide:

In case the link is broken you can see a printed version of it in the [windowsGuide.pdf](./windowsGuide.pdf) here in the repo
